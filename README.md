# Jest with Angular
This repository relates to the article ["Jest with Angular"](http://blog.skarby.info/jest-with-angular) - written on my blog ([blog.skarby.info](http://blog.skarby.info)).

It was also used as base for a presentation given at [ngAarhus](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ngAarhus) on October 30th, 2018.

# Angular CLI
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

# Scripts
To start the application, or run scripts, there's no need to install any global dependencies. Make sure you're running a fairly
new version of `node` (eg. a LTS-release - this was developed using 8.x), and install the dependencies through `npm install`.

- To execute the application (in development mode), simply run the command: `npm start`
- To execute the tests (once), simply run the command: `npm test`
- To execute the tests (in watch mode), simply run the command: `npm run test:watch`
